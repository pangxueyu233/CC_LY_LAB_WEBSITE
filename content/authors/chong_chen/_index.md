Professor, director of Hematologic Tumor Molecular Genetics Laboratory, National Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Medical School, Sichuan University.

My studies focus on the molecular mechanism of the self-renewal and transformation of hematopoietic stem cells. My previous work uncovered the critical role of mTOR pathway in HSC under physiological, pathological and aging conditions. We studied the functions of chromosome large deletions on hematopoietic malignancies and identified the first tumor suppressor MLL3 in Chromosome 7q in leukemia.
